/**
 * Deterministic `deduplicationId` builders for child workflows triggered from
 * inside `step.do` closures (issue #846 RC2). Two invariants, both pinned by
 * dedup-ids.test.ts:
 *
 * 1. Replay-stable: a retried step must produce the identical id so the
 *    existing child instance is reused instead of spawning a second paid job.
 * 2. Run-scoping hash FIRST: `buildInstanceId` (instance-id.ts) keeps only
 *    `100 − prefix` chars of the suffix, truncating from the END, so the hash
 *    that separates two different runs must lead. Truncation may shear the
 *    human-readable tail, never the part that prevents a new run from
 *    colliding with (and silently reusing) a previous run's instance. If
 *    instance-id.ts ever changes its truncation strategy, revisit this.

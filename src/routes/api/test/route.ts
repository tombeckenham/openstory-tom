/**

 * We keep this as a normal (non-pathless) directory so the URLs remain
 * /api/test/user, /api/test/talent, etc. (we want "test" visible in the path).
 *
 * Per the server-routes docs, pathless layouts (`_something`) are the
 * mechanism for applying middleware to a *group* of routes. However,
 * using `_test` here would make the "test" segment pathless, resulting in
 * public URLs like /api/user instead of /api/test/user — which we don't want.
 *
 * Therefore the pragmatic approach is:
 * - Define the single `testOnlyGuard` here (good for comments + one source of truth)
 * - Explicitly attach `middleware: [testOnlyGuard]` on each leaf route in this folder.
 *
 * This matches the style shown throughout the TanStack Start server routes
 * and middleware documentation.
